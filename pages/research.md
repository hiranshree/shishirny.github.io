#### 1. Trajectory optimization of a 6-DOF arm

Trajectory optmization is an important part of motion/path planning methods used to realize dynamic behaviors for robotic systems. The objective of this project is to realize dynamic behaviors in a 6-DOF robotic arm. An important requirement for this goal is real-time trajectory optimization, where optimal trajectories need to be generated within 1s.

#### 2. Robust stabilizing controllers for hybrid systems

Input-to-state stabilizing controllers can be used to overcome a wide variety of uncertainties in both continuous and hybrid systems. This is demonsrated in the humanoid robot DURUS below:

#### 3. Tree climbing

Using canonical functions trajectories of each link of of a robot which is climbing a pole can be described. By using Partial Hybrid Zero Dynamics we can get really efficient and optimal pole climbing techniques.

#### 1. DURUS Humanoid

The objective here was to realize human-like walking behavior in the humanoid robot DURUS. DURUS is a 23-DOF robot with 15 actuators.

#### 2. DURUS-2D

The goal in this project was to realize dynamically stable running with the planar bipedal robot DURUS-2D. DURUS-2D is a 11-DOF robot with 4 actuators. The running realized in the robot consists of a stance phase, and a flight phase occurring in a cyclic fashion to yield dynamically stable running. Input-to-state stabilizing controllers were realized to overcome the phase based disturbances.

#### 3. AMBER2

AMBER2 is a 7-DOF robot with 6 actuators. This robot is unique due to the presence of feet, allowing for multi-contact locomotion with distinct heel and toe behaviors. Various motion primitives like flat-footed walking, multi-contact walking, standing, lunges, heel-lifts, toe-lifts, swinging and also bending of knees. These are demonstrated in the form of dancing below:

#### 4. AMBER

AMBER is a 5-DOF robot and has 4 actuators. AMBER used a simple linear control adaptation for tracking trajectories in each joint with the end result being stable stable walking on the treadmill.

This adaptation was improved further to include motion transitions, with the end result being stable walking on rough terrain.

#### 5. Loop finder

This was my undergraduate project worked in collaboration with Ravi Lanka, in which the robot scans a set of loops and locates the smallest one in the end.
